#arguments         Set the command line arguments.  Type them separated by whitespace as
                   if you were invoking the command from a shell.  The arguments are
                   available in the array variable argv.  In C, C++, and Objective C the
                   size of the array is in argc.
#class             Put the following line outside the main method, but inside class body.
                   For C, C++, and Objective C, the line is put outside the main function
                   and after the header lines.
#delete  <LINE_NO> Delete the indicated line number
#dir     <DIR>     Change to indicated directory.  This clears the session.
#header            Put the following line outside the class body.  For C, C++, and
                   Objective C, the line goes ahead of all function definitions.
#help              Display this menu
#include <HEADER>  Include the indicated header file.
#library <LIBRARY> Edit the indicated library.
#list              List all header lines, class lines, and main lines.
#main              Put the following line inside the main method.  Normally it is not
                   necessary to specify this; will override built-in logic for determing
                   line position.
#rm-lib  <LIBRARY> Remove the indicated library.
