- (done) ability to create libraries (pops into an editor) (finish this)
- (done) write a parser for comments, string literals, and character literals.  Make
  the end of line detector use this parser
- (done) commands: #lib
- (done) commands: #help
- (done) automatically put each line in one of three places: (1) outside of any class
  and main definition, (2) outside main definition but inside class definition, and
  (3) inside main definition.  #include, #import, import, using go in (1).  Java enum
  declaration goes in (2).  Everything else goes in (3)
- (done) fix that ^D causes exception when editing
- (done) unit tests
- (done) if repl restart on project, find existing libraries
- (done) p() as abbrev for puts(), System.out.println(), System.Console.WriteLine(),
- (done) pf() as abbrev for printf(), PrintStream.printf(), ... 
- (done) implement pf for java and c#, it it is possible...
- (done) catch library compilation errors
- (done) don't include headers/use libraries multiple times
- (done) don't require directory to be specified at startup: use a default value
- (done) ability to display and edit lines
- (done) if all lines deleted, flush output
- package as a ruby gem
- (done) ability to define a function or method and have it go to the class line position;
  can code recognize a func/meth definition, or do we need to use a command for this?

- get #class to work in C
- generate a Makefile, Antfile, NAntfile
- ability to specify libraries
- if using to create a library, should also be able to create the unit test for the library
- change executable name to dirname
- framework: C++: stl or boost
- for C#, link regex ddl
- in code, replace COMPILE_EXECUTABLE[LANGUAGE] with language.compile_executable (an object for each language)
- check if needed executables (gcc, java(c), mono, (g)mcs exist...)
- ability to reload lines from previous session
- automatically include dependencies
- unit test #lib
- run from within emacs
- rename lines and new_lines to sess and new_sess
- what happens when running #include with java and C#?
- implement #rm-library
- package for java: if #lib path/to/file or path.to.file, subdirs created and package declaration inserted
- implement import (java) and using (c++)
- library conveniences: in java, set package.  In C++, add #include of header in source
- package clex and crepl as gems
- p,pf -> puts,printf
- templates for main.c etc in separate files
